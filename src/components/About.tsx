              As a founder and CEO of three creative agencies, Eleven, Argonaut and TBD, I've been an evangelist of creative-driven, independent agencies for over 25 years. I'm an entrepreneur that loves conceiving, planning, building, launching, leading, and growing independent creative agencies. My superpower is knowing how to run creative businesses so that my creative partners can focus on the things they love to do and not get bogged down with things they don't.

              I'm now advising founders of creative agencies as a fractional CEO. Additionally, I've assembled a team of fractional experts with extensive agency experience who can help as needed in areas like Finance, Legal, Recruiting, HR, New Business, Marketing, PR, Operations & IT.
